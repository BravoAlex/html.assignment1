            <p>
                Yeah
                I think I'm starting
                To fall in love again
                I'm no prince charming, no
                But I can sure pretend
                See, we can be divine, you and I
                And we can be
                High like the moon and sky
                See, as the world ends (da, da-da-da)
                I think of you
                And as the world ends (da, da-da-da-da)
                We'll set a date for two
                I met you at a café in L.A.
                We planned to meet again
                But then our world went into a disarray
                I know that she will mend
                And we will be just fine, you and I
                And we can be (ooh)
                High like the stars and sky
                'Cause as the world ends (as the world ends)
                (Yeah)
                I think of you
                And as the world ends (as the world ends)
                We'll set a date for two
                See as the world ends, oh (da, da, da, da)
                I dream of you
                And as the world ends (da, da, da, da-da)
                We'll set a date for two
                Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                Oh, hmm
